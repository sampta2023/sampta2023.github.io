</code></pre><p>Submissions that try to squeeze in extra text by tweaking the stylesheet may be summarily rejected.</p><p>Accepted submissions will be granted one extra page of content for the camera-ready version.</p><h2 id=double-blind-reviewing>Double-blind reviewing:</h2><p>Submissions must be anonymized and carefully stripped of identifying information. This applies not only to the main body of the paper, but also the supplement and any linked resources (e.g. GitHub repositories).</p><h2 id=openreview>OpenReview</h2><p>(Details to be announced)</p><h2 id=abstract-submission>Abstract Submission</h2><p>Abstracts must be submitted a week before the full submission deadline. Small edits to the title and abstract are permitted, but submissions whose abstracts are substantively changed may be rejected without further consideration. The author list can be changed until the full paper deadline, after which authors may be reordered, but not added or removed without special permission.</p><h2 id=supplementary-material>Supplementary Material</h2><p>You may include up to 100MB of supplementary material (appendices, proofs, data, source code), in either PDF or ZIP format. Take care that this is anonymized! Reviewers have no obligation to review the supplementary material.</p><h2 id=preprints>Preprints</h2><p>You are allowed to distribute non-anonymous preprints of work submitted to SamPTA.</p><h2 id=dual-submissions>Dual Submissions</h2><p>Submissions to SamPTA will be rejected if they are considered too similar to works previously published, accepted for publication, or submitted in parallel to other peer-reviewed journals. The exception: work from non-archival workshops, such as NeurIPS/ICML workshops, may be submitted.</p><h2 id=author-responses>Author Responses</h2><p>After initial reviews are distributed, authors will have one week to respond. Authors must maintain anonymity in their responses.</p><p>After the response period, accepted papers will be made public, along with their anonymous reviews and comments. Authors of rejected papers may elect to have their deanonymized rejected paper made public in OpenReview.</p><h2 id=publication-of-accepted-submissions>Publication of Accepted Submissions</h2><p>We encourage all authors to make their code and data available along with the publication. Additionally, all camera-ready papers must include a funding disclosure.</p></div></main></body></html>
