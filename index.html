Cubature Formulas on Graphs by Means of Sampling and Interpolation Isaac Pesenson Two types of cubature formulas on combinatorial graphs are developed. Cubature formulas of the first type are obtained through interpolation by variational splines. This set of formulas is exact on spaces of variational splines on graphs. Since bandlimited functions can be obtained as limits of variational splines we obtain cubature formulas which are approximately exact on spaces of bandlimited functions.<div class=read-more-link><a href=/accepted-paper-talks/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://sampta2023.github.io/dinner/>Dinner</a></h1><time datetime=2023-07-07T00:00:00Z class=post-date>Fri, Jul 7, 2023</time>
