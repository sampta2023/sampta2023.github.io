Cubarture Formulas on Graphs by Means of Sampling and Interpolation Isaac Pesenson Two types of cubature formulas on combinatorial graphs are developed. Cubature formulas of the first type are obtained through interpolation by variational splines. This set of formulas is exact on spaces of variational splines on graphs. Since bandlimited functions can be obtained as limits of variational splines we obtain cubature formulas which are approximately exact on spaces of bandlimited functions.<div class=read-more-link><a href=/abstracts/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://sampta2023.github.io/accepted-paper-talks/>Accepted Paper Talks</a></h1><time datetime=2023-07-09T00:00:00Z class=post-date>Sun, Jul 9, 2023</time>

Dinner on Wednesday will be at the Madison Beach Hotel from 6-7pm, and you must register for dinner by Day 1.
The hotel&rsquo;s address is:
Madison Beach Hotel.
94 W Wharf Rd, Madison,
CT 06443, United States
Note: This is in the nearby town of Madison and not in New Haven.
The beach hotel is right by one of the beautiful shoreline beaches of Connecticut. In addition to the hotel having its own small beach, it&rsquo;s next to two public beaches: West Wharf Beach and the Madison Surf Club.<div class=read-more-link><a href=/dinner/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://sampta2023.github.io/excursions/>Excursions</a></h1><time datetime=2023-07-07T00:00:00Z class=post-date>Fri, Jul 7, 2023</time>
SAMPTA 2023 will host three excursions on Wednesday, between 1:00pm-3:30pm:
A guided tour of the Yale Art Gallery (capped at 30 people) A tour of Yale&rsquo;s historic campus (capped at 75 people) A refreshing hike up East Rock (capped at a large but practically infinite number) Please indicate which by filling out the appropriate form here by Day 1. Details on each are below.
